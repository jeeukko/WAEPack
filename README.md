# WAEPack
A community maintained continuation of the now discontinued [J0Pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/j0pack/), WAEPack brings a soft and unique new look to the game.

This README is written towards pack developers. See the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/waepack) for a more user friendly version.

## Download
The latest stable release is available on the [Releases](https://github.com/waeverything/waepack/releases) page.

If you want to try the development version of the pack you can clone/download the repository and put the pack folders into your Minecraft instance's resourcepack directory.

## Textures
Textures can be made using any software though free software such as GIMP is prefered. The project files should be put into their respective folders inside the `src` folder.

## Models
3D models are made using [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/). The project files should be saved into `src/models` folder in case they need to be adjusted in the future.
