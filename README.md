# WAEPack
A community maintained continuation of [J0Pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/j0pack/).

In addition to the base pack there's also `waepack-models` which contains optional 3D textures for blocks like ladders, lily pads, iron bars and more.

## Download
The latest stable release is available on the [Releases](https://github.com/waeverything/waepack/releases) page.
